# Eye Saver Timer App

This macOS application is designed to help users maintain healthy vision by promoting regular eye breaks. It's particularly useful for individuals who spend extended periods working on a computer, helping to prevent issues like myopia (nearsightedness) and eye strain.

## Features

1. **Customizable Timer**
   - Users can set a timer for their desired interval.
   - Once the timer expires, the app sends a notification and displays an alert to remind users to take a break.

2. **Notification System**
   - Notifications are sent through the macOS notification center, ensuring users are reminded even if the app is not in focus.

## Purpose

- **Prevent Myopia:** Prolonged screen time without breaks can lead to myopia and other eye problems. This app encourages healthy habits by reminding users to relax their eyes regularly.
- **Improve Productivity:** Taking short, scheduled breaks improves overall productivity and reduces the risk of burnout and fatigue.

## How It Works

1. Start the timer from the app interface.
2. Receive a notification and alert when the timer finishes.
3. Take a break, look into the distance, and relax your eyes.
